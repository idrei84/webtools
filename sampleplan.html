        <h2>Institution Information</h2>
        <div class="section-content">
            <p><strong>Institution:</strong> Lakeshore Community College</p>
            <p><strong>Prepared by:</strong> Dr. Emily Rodriguez, Dean of Academic Innovation</p>
            <p><strong>Date:</strong> April 14, 2025</p>

        <h2>Section 1: Target Area Selection</h2>
        <div class="section-content">
            <p><strong>Priority Area for AI Integration:</strong> Instruction & Curriculum</p>
            
            <h3>Rationale for Selection:</h3>
            <p>Our faculty have expressed increasing anxiety about students' use of AI tools for assignments while simultaneously showing interest in leveraging these same tools to enhance teaching. Student surveys indicate 72% are already using AI tools, yet only 18% of our faculty feel prepared to address AI in their courses. This disconnect presents both a challenge and opportunity. By focusing on instructional integration, we can transform potential academic integrity issues into learning opportunities while addressing faculty professional development needs.</p>
        </div>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h2>Section 2: Current State Assessment</h2>
        <div class="section-content">
            <h3>Existing Processes:</h3>
            <p>Currently, we have no formal AI policy for either instructors or students. A handful of faculty are independently experimenting with AI in their teaching, while others have created strict anti-AI policies in their syllabi. Our Writing Center has reported increased concerns about detecting AI-written assignments. The Teaching Excellence Center offers occasional workshops on educational technology but has not yet developed AI-specific programming.</p>
            
            <h3>Pain Points/Opportunities:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Inconsistent approaches to AI across departments create confusion for students</li>
                <li>Faculty express anxiety about detecting AI-generated work and maintaining academic integrity</li>
                <li>Students are using AI tools without guidance on appropriate use cases or ethical considerations</li>
                <li>Time constraints limit faculty capacity to redesign assignments or learn new technologies</li>
                <li>Increasing enrollment in our IT programs creates urgency for AI literacy</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Available Resources:</h3>
            <p>We have a recently updated Learning Management System (Canvas) with integration capabilities. Our Teaching Excellence Center has one instructional designer and a $15,000 annual faculty development budget. The IT department has a small AI testing environment. Three faculty members have significant AI expertise and have volunteered to serve as department leads. We also have a $50,000 innovation fund from a recent state workforce development grant.</p>

        <h2>Section 3: Implementation Planning</h2>
        <div class="section-content">
            <h3>Specific AI Solution/Approach:</h3>
            <p>We will implement a three-pronged approach:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Create an "AI-Augmented Teaching Toolkit" with discipline-specific exemplars, assignment templates, and assessment strategies that faculty can customize</li>
                <li>Develop an "AI Literacy Module" for students that can be embedded in any course</li>
                <li>Establish a new "AI in Education" faculty learning community with stipends for participants who develop and share resources</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Resources Needed for Sustainability:</h3>
            <p>To sustain this initiative beyond the initial implementation, we will need:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Dedicated instructional design support (0.5 FTE)</li>
                <li>Annual budget of $25,000 for faculty stipends, training materials, and tool subscriptions</li>
                <li>Integration of AI literacy into First Year Experience and College Success courses</li>
                <li>Regular updates to the AI Teaching Toolkit based on emerging tools and practices</li>

            <p>If successful, this initiative could expand to:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Create a certificate program in "AI for Education" for faculty professional development</li>
                <li>Develop AI-enhanced student support services (tutoring, advising)</li>
                <li>Establish cross-institutional partnerships with other community colleges to share resources</li>
                <li>Create an "AI in Education" resource hub for the wider educational community</li>
                <li>Develop specialized curriculum for workforce programs in AI-adjacent fields</li>

            <h3>Knowledge Sharing Plan:</h3>
            <p>We will document our process and outcomes through:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Quarterly updates to Academic Affairs leadership team and Academic Senate</li>
                <li>Creation of an open repository of successful assignments and approaches</li>
                <li>Bi-annual workshops open to all faculty and staff</li>
